1. **What is Java?**
      - Java is a computer programming language. 
      - Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language. 
      - It allows developers to write code that can run on different types of devices, from computers to mobile phones.
      - Java is strong and reliable.
      - Robustness in Java refers to its ability to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully. 
      - It includes features like strong memory management.
      - Java uses a way of organizing code based on objects.
      - Object-oriented programming is a programming principle that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. This approach promotes code reuse, modularity, and easier maintenance.

2. **Why Java?**

     -  Java is known for being flexible.
     -  Java's adaptability means that it can be used in various scenarios. 
     -  Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale system, Java provides the flexibility to adapt to different requirements and environments.
     - Java works on different types of devices.
     - Being ''platform-independent'' means that Java code can run on various devices, such as computers, smartphones, and other gadgets. This is possible because Java programs are compiled into an intermediate form (bytecode), which can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
     - Java is versatile and excels in a wide range of applications.
     - It is commonly used in web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise systems, scientific applications, and more. 
     - Its broad applicability makes it a popular choice for developers working on diverse projects.



### IDE:
  1. *Definition:*
      An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is like a digital workspace where programmers write, edit, and manage their code. It provides tools such as a code editor, debugger, and compiler, all in one place, making it easier for developers to create and maintain their software.

### Package:
   1. *Definition:*
      In Java, a package is a way to organize and group related classes and interfaces. It helps in avoiding naming conflicts and enhances the overall structure of a program.
   2. *_Naming Convention:*_
      start with lowerCase    

### Class:
   1. *Definition:*
      In Java, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class will have.

### Variables:
   1. *Definition:*
     Variables in Java are like containers that store data. They have a type (int, double, String) and a name. Use variables to store and manipulate data.

### Datatypes:
   1. *Definition:*
       Datatypes specify the type of data a variable can hold.
